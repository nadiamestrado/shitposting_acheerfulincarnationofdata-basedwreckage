	“There is hardly any better example of such digital debris than spam. Far from being the exception in online communication, spam is actually the rule. (…) It forms the bulk of digital writing, its essence. And it, too, has a firm grasp on reality. Far from being secondary and accidental, spam is a substantial expression of a period that has elevated superfluity into one of its guiding principles.”<sub>_Hito Steyerl, Digital Debris, 2011</sub></p>
